# cyclic_cellular_automaton
cellular automaton generates different general types of patterns sequentially, from random initial conditions on sufficiently large grids.  At first, the field is purely random. As cells consume their neighbors and get within range to be consumed by higher-ranking cells, the automaton goes to the consuming phase, where there are blocks of color advancing against remaining blocks of randomness.
